# Array

Array is ordered collection of elements that stored in a contiguous memory location. So we can access the each and every data though indexing. The index in array start with zero. 

### Complexity Analysis

Accessing an element by index: O(1) <br />
Inserting an element at the end: O(1) <br />
Inserting an element at the beginning or middle: O(n) <br />
Deleting an element: O(n) <br />
Searching for an element: O(n) <br />

<h1>Data Structures and Algorithms</h1>

## Data Structure

A data structure is defined as a particular way storing and organizing the data in our device to use the data
efficiently and effectively.
The main idea behind using data structure is to minimize the time complexities.

### why we need Data Structures
<ol type="1">
  <li>
    Efficiency : Data structure provide a better way to store the data efficiently and effectively.
  </li>
  <li>
    Abstraction : Abstraction is the process of simplifying complex systems or ideas by focusing on the essential aspect. It involves hiding the implementation details of program. So this will help developer to focus on higher level concept of program.
  </li>
  <li>Flexibility : Data structure can be adapted to store and manipulate </li>
  <li>Modularity : It can be combined with other data structures and algorithms to make more complex program.</li>
  <li>Standardization : By using established data structure, we can take the advantage of the collective knowledge of the programming community and build more reliable and robust program. </li>

</ol>

## Algorithm 

Algorithm is defined as a process of set of well defined instruction that are typically used to solve a particular group of problems or perform specific type of calculations.

## Complexity Analysis 

Complexity analysis is a process of evaluating the performance of an algorithm in terms if amount of resources it requires to solve a program. These resources can be time or memory or any other measurable factor that can be affect the efficiency of an algorithm. There are two type of complexity analysis :
<dl>
  <dl>Time complexity analysis</dl>
  <dd>The time complexity is used to measure the amount of time is required to execute code.</dd>
  <dl>Space complexity analysis</dl>
  <dd>Space complexity analysis means the amount of space is required to execute successfully the functionalities of the code</dd>
</dl>

## Basic operations


init : initialization of variable.<br/>
set  : Set the value into variable.<br/>
get  : get value<br/>
traversal : travel through the values (array, objects) to execute some functionality.
insert : adding an value at the begging or end or middle of any value (array)<br />
delete : delete value


### How we can find the best then?

## Asymptotic notation 

Asymptotic notation is mathematical tool that calculate the required time in terms of input size and does not required the execution of code.

-> Big-O notation. <br />
-> Omega notation. <br />
-> Theta notation. <br />

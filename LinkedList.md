# Linked list

Linked list is a linear data structure similar to array. But the memory allocated to non-contiguous memory locations. There is no particular index or something to get an particular value. So traversal is necessary to access value. Best choice when the size are dynamically change. The memory is like value with pointer, these called node. The first node is called `head` and end node is called `tail`
